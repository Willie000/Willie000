## 📘 About Me

I’m a robotics enthusiast with a deep interest in autonomous systems, robot software architecture, and learning-based control.  
With a strong foundation in C++, Python, and ROS 2, I enjoy designing modular, scalable robot applications—from low-level perception and control to high-level intelligence.

## 🛠️ Projects

### 🤖 Reinforcement Learning-Based Snake Robot (ENPM690)
Built a multi-joint snake robot in Gazebo using ROS 2 and Python.  
Applied Q-learning for locomotion in a constrained environment. (Spring 2025)

### [🏭 Robotic Manufacturing System in ROS 2 (ENPM663)](https://github.com/Abhey16/group2_ariac) 
GitHub Repo: [https://github.com/Abhey16/group2_ariac](https://github.com/Abhey16/group2_ariac)
Developed C++ ROS 2 nodes for order handling, part detection, and robot behavior in a simulated factory.  
Built and tested with Docker and RViz in the ARIAC competition environment. (Spring 2025)

### 🤝 Human-Robot Interaction Project (ENPM645)
Designed a ROS-based interactive robot that adapts to user gestures and voice inputs.  
Focused on real-time decision making and user feedback loop.

### 🧠 Machine Learning for Robot Vision (ENPM633)
Implemented CNN-based object recognition and real-time inference on ROS-compatible camera feeds.  
Explored transfer learning using PyTorch.
